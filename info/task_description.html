At your work there is a place for the lunch where are 5 microwave ovens (М1, М2, М3, М4, М5). Every microwave could be controlled by remote control with the next commands:<br>
<br>
<strong>set_time</strong>("xx:xx"), where "xx:xx" - time in the minutes and seconds, which shows, how long the eat will be warm up. For example: set_time("05:30")<br>
<strong>add_time</strong>("+Ns"), <strong>add_time</strong>("+Nm"), where N - the amount of the seconds("s") or minutes("m"), which should be added to the current time.<br>
<strong>del_time</strong>("-Ns"), <strong>del_time</strong>("-Nm"), where N - the amount of the seconds("s") or minutes("m"), which should be subtracted from the current time.<br>
<strong>show_time()</strong>, shows current time for the microwave.<br>
<br>
The default time is 00:00. The time is couldn't be less than 00:00 or greater than 90:00, even if add_time or del_time make this happens.
<br>
<br>
Your task is to create 5 classes - one for the each microwave remote control: RemoteControlM1, RemoteControlM2, RemoteControlM3, RemoteControlM4, RemoteControlM5.
Only fifth oven is works properly and shows the full time. The other four have some problems with their displays. They are show time like this:<br>
RemoteControlM1.show_time() == "_0:00"<br>
RemoteControlM2.show_time() == "0_:00"<br>
RemoteControlM3.show_time() == "00:_0"<br>
RemoteControlM4.show_time() == "00:0_"<br>
RemoteControlM5.show_time() == "00:00"<br>
So the 1st microwave doesn't show the 1st time symbol, the 2nd - 2nd symbol and so on.
<br>
In this mission you could use <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern'>Bridge</a> design pattern. Its main task is -  to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Example</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
remote_control_1 = RemoteControlM1()
remote_control_1.set_time("01:00")
    
remote_control_2 = RemoteControlM5()
remote_control_2.del_time("-300s")
remote_control_2.add_time("+100s")
    
remote_control_1.show_time() == "_1:00"
remote_control_2.show_time() == "01:40"
</pre>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>methods of the 5 RemoteControl classes.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>time on the display of the microwave.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    For work with time.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    00:00 <= time <= 90:00
</p>
